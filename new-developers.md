Building your own document search-engine is but a few API calls away.

## Sending

You can use our work-out-of-the-bow providers for standard services (Dropbox, GMail, Salesforce)...
But sometime, you'll want to send your own documents. This is dead simple!

Create the document first:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Neamar/75546fa5013209ced625.js"></script>

And send the file:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Neamar/0ea62c6e3b2bd99f1b5b.js"></script>

## Search

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Neamar/f1481b3a150507f6a686.js"></script>

And you're done!
